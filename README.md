# SongRenamer

SongRenamer allows you to rename files in a set directory.  This can be changed in the program or through
the 'constants.py' file.

The files are cross-referenced via a Google search to determine the accuracy of the title, then will be 
renamed properly.

If the files do not have their artist/title tags on them, they will be added.
